# Heraldish Color Scheme

Heraldish is a color scheme for GUI Vim based on
[herald](https://github.com/h3rald/stash/blob/master/.vim/colors/herald.vim) by
Favio Cevasco. The code and some of the color choices closely follow [Bad
Wolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) by Steve Losh.

256-color terminals are also supported but there are some differences with the
GUI version.

The first screenshot below shows a vim file and the second one a python file.

## Installation

I recommend using [neobundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) and
then simply add `NeoBundle 'petobens/heraldish'` to your `.vimrc` file and run
`:NeoBundleInstall`.

If you don't use a plugin manager copy `heraldish.vim` to your
`.vim/colors` folder.
