# Heraldish Color Scheme #

Heraldish is a color scheme for GUI Vim based on
[herald](https://github.com/h3rald/stash/blob/master/.vim/colors/herald.vim) by
Favio Cevasco. The code and some of the color choices closely follows [Bad
Wolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) by Steve Losh.

256-color terminals are also supported but there are some differences with the
GUI version.

The screenshot below shows a python file on the left and a vim file on the
right.
